V1: Timer and Tracker - complete
Have a adjustable timer with a table
    - make it pretty!
        -table min and max width
    - make table items editable and deletable

V2: Add the backend -> Calendar
Probably gonna look into some kind of sql (postgres?) or mongodb, add a calendar to track multiple sessions/days
- track the sessions over dates
- make table items editable and deletable
- use google calendar api?

Current Goals:
add backend
add sound

Extra
look into how the time input and browser notification were made
    - get rid of hours/minutes when not using? (probably requires creating own component, looking into how to use typescript)

Pretty goals:
- make side pop out for table and calendar
    -table min and max width, table columns fixed lengths...
- wavy background :D
